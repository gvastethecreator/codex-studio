# Architecture Deepening Roadmap

This roadmap tracks refactors that turn shallow modules into deeper modules with better locality, leverage, and testability. Related decisions live in `docs/adr/`.

## Concepts

- **Depth:** a small interface that hides significant useful behavior.
- **Locality:** related behavior changes in one place instead of many callers.
- **Deletion test:** if deleting a module makes complexity disappear, it was likely a pass-through. If complexity reappears across many callers, the module was earning its keep.

## Phase 1: backend foundation

- ADR 0002: callable app factory.
- ADR 0003: extract reference manager.
- ADR 0004: platform paths seam.
- ADR 0005: split Codex client module.
- ADR 0006: SSE job watcher.
- ADR 0007: consolidate generation flows.

## Phase 2: frontend state and components

- ADR 0010: decompose god contexts.
- ADR 0011: decompose `AppContent` god component.
- ADR 0013: resolve the catalog/batch dual model.

## Phase 3: recipes and UI modules

- ADR 0012: recipe context builder seam.
- ADR 0015: extract the 3D viewport from the Camera recipe.

## Phase 4: data model migration

- ADR 0008: multi-library disk catalog.
- ADR 0009: embedded image metadata.
- ADR 0014: backend dependency-injection seams.
- ADR 0016: deduplicate image extraction.
- ADR 0017: centralize configuration.

## Recommended order

1. Backend foundation first, so the local API can be tested and supervised cleanly.
2. Frontend state next, so the shell can consume fewer shallow interfaces.
3. Recipe and UI module extraction in parallel where it does not disrupt data migration.
4. Catalog-first data migration once sync, SSE, and shell boundaries are stable.

## Success metrics

- **Testability:** modules can be tested through their public interface without unrelated module mocking.
- **Modularity:** deleting one module does not break unrelated concerns.
- **AI navigability:** understanding how an image is generated should not require reading many unrelated files.
- **Operational clarity:** logs, health, and diagnostics should lead users to the next action.
